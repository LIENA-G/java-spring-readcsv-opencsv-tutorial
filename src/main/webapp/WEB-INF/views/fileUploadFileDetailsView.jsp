- isELIgnored : JSP Expression Language (EL) is useful and is evaluated in JSP pages by default since Servlet 2.4. However, sometimes we would not want to evaluate EL, e.g. keep everything in the pattern ${..} looks as it is. In JSP, itâ€™s possible to deactivate EL evaluation for a single JSP page for a group of JSPs.
