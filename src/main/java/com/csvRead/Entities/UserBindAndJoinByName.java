/*
Why openCsv choose to use s MultiValuedMap to implement this CsvBindAndJoinByName? Why not a simple List and everyone is happy? Two reasons: First, someone will want to know what the header was actually named on reading, and second, opencsv needs to know what the header is named when it writes beans to a CSV file. And really, at least for reading, a MultiValuedMap isnâ€™t that cumbersome: Mostly you will want a list of all values, not caring about which header they were under, and that can simply be had by calling values() on the field.
